This web server hosts a simple web site that allows image uploads, and prints all incoming files. My set-up uses a Raspberry Pi, connected to a Star TSP-100 thermal printer via CUPS. The web server is written in C# using the [Nancy project](http://nancyfx.org/). Contact me if you are interested in implementing this somewhere else!
