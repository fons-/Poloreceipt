The printi project consists of:
- üñ® the _printi mini_, a thermal printer that connects to your wifi network, and
- üåê the _[printi.me](https://printi.me/)_ website, allowing anyone to quickly send pictures to your _printi mini_.

Images sent to printi.me are printed _within a second_ after uploading, making it the **fastest way to print a photo from anyone's smart phone or computer** (i think).

**FAQ for printi mini owners: [help.printi.me](https://help.printi.me)**
